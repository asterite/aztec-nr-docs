<h2>Methods</h2><code class="code-header">pub fn <span class="fn">compute_note_hash</span>(self: Self, storage_slot: Field) -> Field</code>

<div class="padded-description"><div class="comments">
<p>Returns the non-siloed note hash, i.e. the inner hash computed by the contract during private execution. Note
hashes are later siloed by contract address and hashed with note nonce by the kernels before being committed to
the state tree.</p>
<p>This should be a commitment to the packed note, including the storage slot (for indexing) and some random
value (to prevent brute force trial-hashing attacks).</p>
</div>
</div><code class="code-header">pub fn <span class="fn">compute_nullifier</span>(
    self: Self,
    context: &mut <a href="../../../noir_aztec/context/private_context/struct.PrivateContext.html" class="struct">PrivateContext</a>,
    note_hash_for_nullify: Field,
) -> Field</code>

<div class="padded-description"><div class="comments">
<p>Returns the non-siloed nullifier (also called inner-nullifier), which will be later siloed by contract address
by the kernels before being committed to the state tree.</p>
<p>This function MUST be called with the correct note hash for consumption! It will otherwise silently fail and
compute an incorrect value. The reason why we receive this as an argument instead of computing it ourselves
directly is because the caller will typically already have computed this note hash, and we can reuse that value
to reduce the total gate count of the circuit.</p>
<p>This function receives the context since nullifier computation typically involves proving nullifying keys, and
we require the kernel's assistance to do this in order to prevent having to reveal private keys to application
circuits.</p>
</div>
</div><code class="code-header">pub unconstrained fn <span class="fn">compute_nullifier_unconstrained</span>(self: Self, note_hash_for_nullify: Field) -> Field</code>

<div class="padded-description"><div class="comments">
<p>Like <code>compute_nullifier</code>, except this variant is unconstrained: there are no guarantees on the returned value
being correct. Because of that it doesn't need to take a context (since it won't perform any kernel key
validation requests).</p>
