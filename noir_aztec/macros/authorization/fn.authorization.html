<div class="comments">
<p>An Authorization is a struct that represents an action a user can allow others to do
on their behalf. By definition, an Authorization must be human-readable and contain
enough information to be interpreted on its own. Authorizations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emitted as offchain effects to convey the piece of data a contract needs to be signed
in order to perform the action</li>
<li>Hashed in a specific way to produce an inner_hash that can later be signed and checked
via the authwit mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows a contract developer to convey to a user in a human-readable way what they are asked to sign,
while keeping the account contract interface simple (it just has to check if a hash was signed). It should
always be possible to recompute the inner_hash from the Authorization alone, so the user/wallet
can verify the action they are signing.</p>
