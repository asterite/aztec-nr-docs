<p>Compute the <code>message_hash</code> from a function call to be used by an authentication witness</p>
<p>Useful for when you need a non-account contract to approve during execution. For example if you need a contract
to make a call to nested contract, e.g., contract A wants to exit token T to L1 using bridge B, so it needs to allow
B to transfer T on its behalf.</p>
<p>@param caller The address of the contract that is calling the function, in the example above, this would be B
@param consumer The address of the contract that is consuming the message, in the example above, this would be T
@param chain_id The chain id of the chain that the message is being consumed on
@param version The version of the chain that the message is being consumed on
@param selector The function selector of the function that is being called
@param args The arguments of the function that is being called</p>
