<p>Poseidon2 Encryption.</p>
<p>~160 constraints to encrypt 8 fields. Use this hash if you favour proving speed over long-term privacy for your users.</p>
<p>WARNING: Poseidon2 as an <em>encryption scheme</em> isn't considered as secure as more battle-tested encryption schemes, e.g. AES128.
This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's relatively new;</li>
<li>it isn't used much in the wild, so there's less incentive for hackers or bounty hunters to try to break it;</li>
<li>it doesn't provide post-quantum privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to protect your users' privacy decades into the future, it might be prudent to choose
a more 'traditional' encryption scheme.
If your app is &quot;lower stakes&quot;, and your users will only care about their privacy in the near future or immediate future, then
this encryption scheme might be for you!</p>
<p>See the paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EVrP3DzoGbmzkRmYnyEDcIQcXVU7GlOd/view</p>
<p>Note: The return length is: L padded to the next multiple of 3, plus 1 for a message auth code of s[1].</p>
<p>@param encryption_nonce is only needed if your use case needs to protect against replay attacks.</p>
