<h2>PrivateSet</h2>
<p>PrivateSet is a private state variable type, which enables you to read, mutate,
and write private state within the #[private] functions of your smart contract.</p>
<p>You can declare a state variable of type PrivateSet within your contract's
#[storage] struct:</p>
<p>E.g.:
<code>your_variable: PrivateSet&lt;YourNote, Context&gt;</code>
or:
<code>your_mapping: Map&lt;Field, PrivateSet&lt;YourNote, Context&gt;&gt;</code></p>
<p>The PrivateSet type operates over notes, by facilitating: the insertion
of new notes, the reading of existing notes, and the nullification of existing
notes.</p>
<p>The methods of PrivateSet are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>insert</code></li>
<li><code>pop_notes</code></li>
<li><code>get_notes</code></li>
<li><code>remove</code>
(see the methods' own doc comments for more info).</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;current value&quot; of a PrivateSet state variable is represented as a
<em>collection</em> (or &quot;Set&quot;) of multiple notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More exactly, the 'current value' is the collection of all
<em>not-yet-nullified</em> notes in the set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Example.</h2>
<p>A user's token balance can be represented as a PrivateSet of multiple notes,
where the note type contains a value.
The &quot;current value&quot; of the user's token balance (the PrivateSet state variable)
can be interpreted as the summation of the values contained within all
not-yet-nullified notes (aka &quot;current notes&quot;) in the PrivateSet.</p>
<p>This is similar to a physical wallet containing five $10 notes: the owner's
wallet balance is the sum of all those $10 notes: $50.
To spend $2, they can get one $10 note, nullify it, and insert one $8 note as
change. Their new wallet balance will then be interpreted as the new summation: $48.</p>
<p>The interpretation doesn't always have to be a &quot;summation of values&quot;. When
<code>get_notes</code> is called, PrivateSet does not attempt to interpret the notes at all;
it's up to the custom code of the smart contract to make an interpretation.</p>
<p>For example: a set of notes could instead represent a moving average; or a modal
value; or some other single statistic. Or the set of notes might not be
collapsible into a single statistic: it could be a disjoint collection of NFTs
which are housed under the same &quot;storage slot&quot;.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that a user can prove existence of <em>at least</em> some subset
of notes in a PrivateSet, but they cannot prove existence of <em>all</em> notes
in a PrivateSet.
The physical wallet is a good example: a user can prove that there are five
$10 notes in their wallet by furnishing those notes. But because we cannot
<em>see</em> the entirety of their wallet, they might have many more notes that
they're choosing to not showing us.</p>
<h2>When to choose PrivateSet vs PrivateMutable:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want <em>someone else</em> (other than the owner of the private state) to be
able to make edits (insert notes).</li>
<li>If you don't want to leak the storage_slot being initialized (see the
PrivateMutable file).</li>
<li>If you find yourself needing to re-initialize a PrivateMutable (see that file).</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'current' value of a <em>PrivateMutable</em> state variable is only ever represented
by <em>one</em> note at a time. To mutate the current value of a PrivateMutable, the
current note always gets nullified, and a new, replacement note gets inserted.
So if nullification is always required to mutate a PrivateMutable, that means
only the 'owner' of a given PrivateMutable state variable can ever mutate it.
For some use cases, this can be too limiting: A key feature of some smart contract
functions is that <em>multiple people</em> are able to mutate a particular state
variable.</p>
<p>PrivateSet enables &quot;other people&quot; (other than the owner of the private state) to
mutate the 'current' value, with some limitations:
The 'owner' is still the only person with the ability to <code>remove</code> notes from the
the set.
&quot;Other people&quot; can <code>insert</code> notes into the set.</p>
<p>It's important to notice that the &quot;owner&quot; of a state variable is an abstract
concept which will differ depending on the rules of a smart contract. When we
talk about the &quot;owner&quot; in the context of these aztec-nr files, we tend to mean
&quot;the person who has the ability to nullify the state variable's notes&quot;.
Notice that the state variable abstractions of aztec-nr do not know what an
&quot;owner&quot; is: they delegate responsibility of understanding who the &quot;owner&quot; of a
note is to the note itself, via a <code>compute_nullifier</code> call.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>The methods of a PrivateSet are only executable in a PrivateContext, and are
designed to not leak anything about <em>which</em> state variable was read/modified/
inserted, to the outside world.</p>
<p>The design of the Note does impact the privacy of the state variable: the note
will need to contain a <code>randomness</code> field so that, when hashed, the contents of
the note are private.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we decided to explicitly require <code>randomness</code> in a note definition,
because we anticipated use cases where notes might also be used to store
certain <em>public</em> state. We might roll-back that decision, so that users don't
need to worry about handling their own randomness when defining custom notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The design of the note's custom <code>compute_nullifier</code> method will also impact the
privacy of the note at the time it is nullified. (Note: all Notes must implement
<code>compute_nullifier</code> to be compatible with PrivateSet). See the docs.</p>
<h2>Struct Fields:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>context - The execution context (PrivateContext or UtilityContext).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>storage_slot -  All notes that &quot;belong&quot; to a given PrivateSet state variable
are augmented with a common <code>storage_slot</code> field, as a way of
identifying which set they belong to. (Management of <code>storage_slot</code> is handled
within the innards of the PrivateSet impl, so you shouldn't need to think about
this any further).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Generic Parameters:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>Note</code> - Many notes of this type will collectively form the PrivateSet at the
given storage_slot.</li>
<li><code>Context</code> - The execution context (PrivateContext or UtilityContext).</li>

<h4>Advanced:</h4>
<p>Ultimately, this function inserts the <code>note</code> into the protocol's Note Hash
Tree.
Behind the scenes, we do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Augment the note with the <code>storage_slot</code> of this PrivateSet, to
convey which set it belongs to.</li>
<li>Augment the note with a <code>note_type_id</code>, so that it can be correctly filed-
away when it is eventually discovered, decrypted, and processed by its
intended recipient.
(The note_type_id is usually allocated by the #[note] macro).</li>
<li>Provide the contents of the (augmented) note to the PXE, so that it can
store all notes created by the user executing this function.
<ul>
<li>The note is also kept in the PXE's memory during execution, in case this
newly-created note gets <em>read</em> in some later execution frame of this
transaction. In such a case, we feed hints to the kernel to squash:
the so-called &quot;transient note&quot;, its note log (if applicable), and the
nullifier that gets created by the reading function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hash the (augmented) note into a single Field, via the note's own
<code>compute_note_hash</code> method.</li>
<li>Push the <code>note_hash</code> to the PrivateContext. From here, the protocol's
kernel circuits will take over and insert the note_hash into the protocol's
&quot;note hash tree&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Before insertion, the protocol will:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Silo&quot; the <code>note_hash</code> with the <code>contract_address</code> of the calling
function, to yield a <code>siloed_note_hash</code>. This prevents state collisions
between different smart contracts.</li>
<li>Ensure uniqueness of the <code>siloed_note_hash</code>, to prevent Faerie-Gold
attacks, by hashing the <code>siloed_note_hash</code> with a unique value, to
yield a <code>unique_siloed_note_hash</code> (see the protocol spec for more).</li>

<p>The act of nullifying convinces us that the returned notes are indeed
